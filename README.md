## Color (Spigot 1.8.8) â€“ Plugin Scaffold
This plugin has been made originally to be used alongside a minecraft RPG UHC game. The goal is to visually mark other players if they are sus or safe.

Inspired if not serving the exact same purpose as /lg color command in Lapin's Loup Garou UHC Plugin.

Code is under MIT Licence, if you want any updates / Bugfixes, ask nicely or do it yourself.

I have no experience making Spigot Plugin and made this nearly entierly using Cursor. I don't care if the code is AI written as long as I can read it and it works.

Any other version that is not 1.8.8 is not tested, it may works, but I won't do bugfixes if the bug don't happend in 1.8.8 server.

From what I've tested, the plugin doesn't interfere with custom tablist set by other plugin, it overwrite just the players names to the correct color.

The plugin set the player topbar and the tablist to the color set using /color command.

### Requirements
- JDK 8
- Maven 3.8+

### Build
See `docs/BUILD.md`.

### Deploy
See `docs/DEPLOY.md`.

### Usage
- `/color` opens a player picker GUI (with online player's heads) for quick selection.
- `/color <player> <player2> ...` (up to 10 targets) opens a GUI for the caller.
- Caller selects a wool: 16 classic colors; white resets to default for the caller's view.
- Colors are local to the caller and non-persistent (disconnecting and reconnecting to the server don't reset the sets colors, but if the server restarts, everything is cleared (and yes it's a feature)).
